*)It's a HEAT SYSTEM: that can react to the variation of the HEAT temperature. *)it's consists of two systems, each of them consists of highly seprated dc motor. *)The first system(System1):It triggers when heat temperature goes from 20 to 0. *)The second system(System2):It triggers when heat temperature goes from 25 to 40. *)Finally,the Temperature between 20 to 25:it's about a free system. *)There a warrning if the temperature reaches to 40 or Greater *)When temperature reaches this far,An expected BUZZER shall turn on.,At this situation  there must be an immediate interception.
