# ITI-Training-HEAT-SYSTEM-Final-Project
>>It's a HEAT SYSTEM: that can react to the variation of the HEAT temperature. 
>>it's consists of two systems, each of them consists of highly seprated dc motor.
>>The first system(System1):It triggers when heat temperature goes from 20 to 0. 
>>The second system(System2):It triggers when heat temperature goes from 25 to 40.
>>Finally,the Temperature between 20 to 25:it's about a free system. 
>>There a warrning if the temperature reaches to 40 or Greater 
>>When temperature reaches this far,An expected BUZZER shall turn on, At this situation  there must be an immediate interception.
